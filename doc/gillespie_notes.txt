1. Setup
   - store initial populations and rate constants

2. Calculate reaction propensities
3. Generate two uniform random numbers
4. calculate reaction time using random 1
5. Determine the next reaction using r2
5. add t reaction to total time
6. Update the populations based on reaction chosen
7. go to step until stopping condition is reached.

The partial sum table is partitioned according to the size of the reaction/totalFlux.
This is where the inequality comes into play, i.e, partialSum >= r2*totalFlux


QUESTIONS:

1. What is my stopping condition? When I have a structure?
3. Sampling probability distribution or is this the partial sum table?
4. What are the ideal backbone functions that need to be in place?


PROBLEM:
1. My structures do not make sense.
