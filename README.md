This repository contains partially developed computational tools for RNA secondary structure prediction. Below I have provided a helpful map to find certain files that may be of interest.

## src -> explore 
Machine learning code is found here. Specifically, under **cnn**, you will find all of the python files for the convolutional neural network that we developed for secondary structure prediction. 

Also, there contains the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the figures in the report.

## src -> kinetic_RNA 
Here is the stem level Gillespie algo that we developed. The main program is *gillespie.py*. It has dependenices *helperfunctions.py* and *RFE_landscape.py*.

Also, there is a Jupyter notebook to reproduce the figures in the report. 

## data_set -> ct_files 
Rfam data set

## datat_set -> src.txt/tgt.txt
Pseudobase data set

## doc -> rotation report
PHY 500 Research Methods report is here. (*.pdf* and *.tex*)
